##
Lee's Korean Martial Arts wants us to create a website that show what services they offer, their location and current schedule, and what values they have.  Additionally, the website should offer users the ability to sign-up for an account in order to view their current curriculum and upload completed documents.  Users should be able to see family members curriculum as well.

## Project Timeline
In this first semester, we focused on building some of the Front-End Pages & Navbar:
- Home Page
- About Page
- FAQ Page
- Programs Page

In Fall 2022, during CSC 191, our timeline looks like this:
- Create Contact/Location Page
- Create Calendar Page using Google Calendar API
- Create Gallery Page
- Create Profile Page

These last few Front-End Pages will likely be created quickly, thus we will quickly turn focus toward implementing a database for users to sign-up, log-in, and eventually view their profiles
- Build Database to store hashed usernames & passwords, in addition to other information
- Work to integrate Database with Front-End Pages
- Create Family Profile Views
- Once User Profiles are implemented and working, we will add functionality for users to upload files

If time permits and if possible, we wish to integrate MyStudio, a membership management service
